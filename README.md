Hi! This is the start of your README. 
The core idea here is to be a welcoming and authentic introduction.

### Hello there! üëã I'm Subrata.

I'm a software engineering student at **IIT Guwahati**, and I'm deeply passionate about building things that solve real problems. My journey into tech started not with writing codes, but with androis hacks and mods and an Electrical Engineering education, which gave me a lasting curiosity for how things work at a fundamental level.

These days, I spend most of my time diving into the world of **scalable systems**, blending the rigor of Data Structures and Algorithms with the practical challenges of building full-stack applications in HTML and JavaScript, Node.js and playing with Rust and C++.

<h3 align="left">What I'm Focusing On Now:</h3>
<p align="left">
  Right now, my learning is centered around a few key areas that I find fascinating:
</p>

*   üîí **Protocol Security:** Going deep into the world of Web3 security and smart contract safety with the **School of Solana**.
*   üíª 
*   üèÜ **Competitive Problem Solving:** Consistently working on my DSA skills and preparing for the next challenge.
*   üåå **The Next Frontier:** Tinkering with quantum circuits and exploring future computing paradigms, a passion sparked by my time at the **CDAC Summer training and IBM Qiskit Summer School**.
*   üìö **Reading Books:** Reading few books on designing Data Intensive Apps and Computer Systems, how they works. ü§îüßê

<h3 align="left">Connecting the Dots...</h3>
<p align="left">
  I believe the most interesting challenges live at the intersection of different fields. That's why I'm always exploring:
</p>

-   How the **economic models of DeFi protocols** create new challenges in security and system design.
-   The future of cryptography, and how we can build systems today that are resistant to the threats of tomorrow (**Post-Quantum Cryptography**).
-   The spirit of open-source and my early roots in the **Android development (XDA)** community.
